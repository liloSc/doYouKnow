# doYouKnow
DO YOU KNOW is a 2D personalized educational maze game designed to help children learn. This game provides each kid with a personal experience suitable to their age and knowledge of a particular subject. The user plays as Bello, a dog who has been trapped and transported to a mysterious wilderness world. Bello must answer different quests if he ever hopes to find his way back home. Tools can be caught along the way to enhance the chances of success. 
When finishing the game, the user will level up. The next level will have more tasks than the one before. The quests will differ based on what level the user is on.
